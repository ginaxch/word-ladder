# word-ladder
This Java program solves word ladder puzzles by transforming a 5-letter start word into an end word, one letter at a time, using valid dictionary words. It uses stacks, queues, and sets to explore possible transformations efficiently and returns a valid word ladder path if one exists.


## Features
- Interactive console-based user interface
- Accepts user input for start and end words
- Validates input (5-letter words only)
- Loads dictionary words from `words.txt`
- Uses BFS to find the shortest transformation sequence
- Handles invalid inputs and missing files gracefully

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Set
- File I/O

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Place the `words.txt` dictionary file in the project root.
3. Compile and run the Java program:
```bash
WordLadder.java
